window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>B. V. Larson returns to the world of his Audible best-selling Star Force series for the first time in three years with this original, full-cast audio drama.</b></p> <p>A new stand-alone space drama by B. V. Larson makes its debut in the wildly popular Star Force series with an extensive and stellar cast. When the Ancients, a mysterious alien race, vanished before Earth's last ice age, they left behind a highway of interconnected rings across the galaxy. Humanity knows how to use the highway, but not how to build any more rings, or alter the connection pattern between them.</p> <p>Now the Imperial starship <i>Pandora</i> is on a mission to discover and explore new interstellar connection points. On Venus, they meet a rogue robot, Marvin, with a mission of his own to reconnect the rings into a new pattern. The result is pure pandemonium. Everything goes haywire. Grotesque aliens are coming through the ring, overrunning Pandora's base camp.</p> <p>The good news? The aliens can be killed. The bad news: The aliens keep coming through the ring, and no one knows how to turn off the connection leading directly to their home world. But even if the aliens can be defeated - thereâ€™s still Marvin to contend with and his alternate agenda.</p> <p><i>Starship Pandora</i> is performed by:</p> <p>Mark Boyett as Marvin and Gen. Kerr; Marc Vietor as Maj. Drake; Tim Gerard Reynolds as Dr. Blear; Scott Aiello as Capt. Stiles; Natalie Gold as Lt. Hersh; Jamie Jackson as Emperor Crow; Graeme Malcolm as Adm. Newcome.</p> <p>With additional roles performed by Kevin T. Collins; Lauren Fortgang; Natasha Soudek; Jeena Yi; Gabriel Vaughan; Josh Hurley; Eddy Lee; and B. V. Larson.</p> <p>Experience this title in immersive 3D audio by <a href=\"https://help.audible.com/s/article/how-can-i-change-the-download-format-settings-in-the-audible-for-android-and-audible-for-ios-apps/\">setting your download quality to High</a> within the app. Headphones recommended.
