window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tilly Bridges is one part of the trans woman / cis woman writing team (with her wife Susan) and creators of comics, screenplays, teleplays and audio dramas. On June 27th, Bridges releases BEGIN TRANSMISSION – The Trans Allegories of the Matrix, tracking one person’s transition journey — from Thomas Anderson, to Neo, to Trinity. <br><br>As a transgender woman, Bridges said she had always connected with the Matrix movies on a level so strongly that she didn’t understand. The first time she watched the movies after coming out publicly was revelatory. “I was motivated to rewatch and take notes,” says Bridges. “My entire world turned upside down as I discovered almost frame by frame how deep and layered the allegories were within the films.” Since sharing her essays, she’s been overwhelmed with messages from people her essays have helped. One person said it saved their life. <br><br>Making award-winning audio drama via their production company Pendant Productions since 2004, Tilly and her wife have had six shows crack Apple Podcasts’ top 60 scripted sci-fi shows of all time.” Tilly and Susan are also head writers of the 2023 Nebula Awards and are presently writing for the new Monster High animated series and the Star Trek Adventures an Fallout role-playing games. She lives in Los Angeles. <br><br>CONNECT WITH TILLY ONLINE <br>Official Website: birdguest.com <br>Twitter: @TillyBridges <br>Instagram: @heckyeahtillybridges</p> <p>Support the Show.</p><p>Instagram: GenderStories<br>Hosted by Alex Iantaffi<br>Music by Maxwell von Raven<br>Gender Stories logo by Lior Effinger-Weintraub</p> <p><br></p>";
